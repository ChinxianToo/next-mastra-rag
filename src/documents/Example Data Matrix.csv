Incident,Hardware,Printer,,,,LJP - Unable to print,,"Step 1:Before you do anything else, turn off the printer and unplug it from the power source
Step 2:Your printer will have one or more access panels or doors that allow you to get to the paper path. This might be a front cover, a rear access door, or the paper tray slot
Step 3: Carefully inspect the inside of the printer to find where the paper is stuck. It could be near the paper tray, wrapped around the rollers, or close to the output tray
Step 4: Once you've located the jam, gently and slowly pull the paper in the direction of the normal paper path. Try to pull it out straight without tearing it. If the paper does tear, do your best to retrieve all the small, torn pieces, as any leftover scraps can cause future jams. If the paper is difficult to remove from one direction, see if you can access it from another panel to ease it out
